                <h2>介绍</h2>
                <p>我是binginto,在20多年前对这个世界讲出我的第一句问好。</p>

                <p>小时候的故事已经记忆不太清楚,只是印象中小时候的自己看过好多的书。不过这里多和书都只是按着小孩子
                  角度定义，诸如《知音》,《读者》,《故事会》,《广州日报》等这类报刊或者各种XX未解之谜，或从春秋到
                  当代的中外各种故事集。所以我小时候自以为很了不起,夜郎自大，坐井观天。看了哈利波特，就想同样写一部
                  长篇巨著，借此扬名立万。最后是不了了之。
                </p>

                <p>初高中时候先后受过郭敬明先生和韩寒先生的感染。作文风格也先从我仰望45度角的天空,悲伤在心内逆流成河
                  的无厘头悲伤转为七个红灯笼，照亮我前程的无厘头愤世嫉俗。还追过一段时间韩寒先生的博客，也见证了韩寒
                  先生从嘲讽微博，绝不会发微博，140字无法表达内心的想法，再到现在几千万粉丝的真香转变。那时候有一个很
                  奇怪的想法，认为自己很聪明。一个聪明的人不需要太努力，因为我没打算去读清华，读中大就好。而我太努力
                  考到清华的分数就读中大，太亏了。所以应该懒散点。而且事实证明，我并不是一个聪明人。即使后面很努力做题,
                  还是距离中大很远,大概干掉排在我前面两万来人，才可以去中大的水平。
                </p>

                <p>大学时代跟很多人一样，雄心壮志进去，懒懒散散出来。而且大学时代已经很少看书了,只是偶尔看下小说，感受
                  里面主角的升级打怪。更多是的玩游戏，手机游戏和Pc游戏。大概打了两三千局的lol,四年下来。不过段位还是白银
                  黄金。而成绩和技能也跟段位一般，普普通通。但还是找到工作了,去了深圳的一间公司工作，一年多后又跑回广州。
                  留下的记忆就是大南山,深圳大学，科技园，和深圳臭臭的海以及高新园一套一千万的房子。
                </p>

                <p>毕业至今，已经工作3年多了。做了3年多的技术，也是时候从用轮子到造轮子的阶段转变了，也是时候构建自己的体系
                  。其实之前也定过很多规划，但大部分都无疾而终。有时候，我会跟人讲，其实我最初希望的职业不是做程序员，而是导演。等我财富自由了，我要当
                  导演。这就是单纯的想法，跟小时候扬名立望的巨著一样，不了了之是最可能的结果。但未来的事，谁知道呢？
                </p>

                <p>我跟过一些朋友讲过，人生最值钱就是希望，希望是前行的动力。我是binginto，有着对前路的期盼。希望在前行的路上，
                  我立的规划，一一成真，可以对这个世界讲出我讲过的事，我做得到！</p>

                <h2>The honeymoon</h2>
                <p>The origin of the honeymoon is not generally known.</p>

                <p>The Saxons long and long ago got up the delightful occasion. Amongst the
                  ancient Saxons and Teutons a beverage was made of honey and water, and
                  sometimes flavored with mulberries. This drink was used especially at
                  weddings and the after festivals. These festivals were kept up among the
                  nobility sometimes for a month--"monath." The "hunig monath" was thus
                  established, and the next moon after the marriage was called the
                  honeymoon.</p>

                <p>Alaric, about the fifth century king of the Saxons and Western Goths, is
                  said to have actually died on his wedding night from drinking too freely
                  of the honeyed beverage,--at least he died before morning,--and it
                  certainly would seem to be a charitable inference to draw, since he
                  partook very deeply of the "festive drink." It was certainly a sweet
                  oblivion, "yet it should be a warning to posterity, as showing that even
                  bridegrooms may make too merry."</p>

                <p>Dr. Blanchet recently read a paper before the Academy of Science, Paris,
                  relative to some cases of "long sleep," or lethargic slumber. One of them
                  related to a lady twenty years of age, who took a sleeping fit during her
                  _honeymoon_, which lasted fifty days.</p>

                <p>"During this long period a false front tooth had to be taken out in order
                  to introduce milk and broth into her mouth. This was her only food; she
                  remained motionless, insensible, and all her muscles were in a state of
                  contraction. Her pulse was low, her breathing scarcely perceptible; there
                  was no evacuation, no leanness; her complexion was florid and healthy.
                  The other cases were exactly similar. Dr. Blanchet is of opinion that in
                  such cases no stimulants or forced motion ought to be employed.</p>

                <p>"The report did not say whether the husband was pleased or not with her
                  long silence."</p>

                <p>There is too much talk in the world about woman's "_jaw_." As for me, give
                  me the woman who can _talk_; the faster and more sense the better.</p>

                <h2>A drawing joke</h2>
                <p>Several kings and great lords are made mention of as being particularly
                  fond of using the lancet. Peter the Great of Russia was remarkably fond of
                  witnessing dissections and surgical operations. He even used to carry a
                  case of instruments in his pocket. He often visited the hospitals to
                  witness capital operations, at times assisting in person, and was able to
                  dissect properly, to bleed a patient, and extract a tooth as well as one
                  of the faculty.</p>

                <p>The pretty wife of one of the czar's valets had the following unpleasant
                  experience of his skill. The husband of the "maid" accused her of
                  flirting, and vowed revenge. The czar noticed the valet seated in the
                  ante-room, looking forlorn, and asked the cause of his dejection. The
                  wicked valet replied that his wife had a tooth which gave her great pain,
                  keeping them both awake day and night, but would not have it drawn.</p>

                <p>"Send her to me," said the czar.</p>

                <p>The woman was brought, but persisted in affirming that her teeth were
                  sound, and never ached. The valet alleged that this was always the way she
                  did when the physician was called; therefore, in spite of her cries and
                  remonstrances, the king ordered her husband to hold her head between his
                  knees, when the czar drew out his instruments and instantly extracted the
                  tooth designated by the husband, disregarding the cries of the unfortunate
                  victim.</p>

                <p>In a few days the czar was informed that the thing was a put-up job by the
                  jealous husband, in order to punish, if not mar the beauty of, his gallant
                  wife, whereupon the instruments were again brought into requisition; and
                  this time the naughty valet was the sufferer, to the extent of losing a
                  sound and valuable tooth.</p>

                <h2>Commencing practice</h2>
                <p>From that excellent work, "Scenes in the Practice of a New York Surgeon,"
                  by Dr. E. H. Dixon, I copy, with some abbreviation, the following, which
                  the author terms "Leaves from the Log-book of an Unfledged Æsculapian:"--</p>

                <p>"In the year 1830 I was sent forth, like our long-suffering and
                  much-abused prototype,--old father Noah's crow,--from the ark of safety,
                  the old St. Duane Street College. I pitched my tent, and set up my trap,
                  in what was then a fashionable up-town street.</p>

                <p>"I hired a modest house, and had my arm-chair, my midnight couch, and my
                  few books in my melancholy little office, and I confess that I now and
                  then left an amputating-knife, or some other awful-looking instrument, on
                  the table, to impress the poor women who came to me for advice.</p>

                <p>"These little matters, although the 'Academy' would frown upon them, I
                  considered quite pardonable. God knows I would willingly have adopted
                  their most approved method of a splendid residence, and silver-mounted
                  harnesses for my bays; but they were yet in dream-land, eating moonbeams,
                  and my vicious little nag had nearly all this time to eat his oats and
                  nurse his bad temper in his comfortable stable.</p>

                <p>"In this miserable way I read over my old books, watered my
                  rose-bushes,--sometimes with tears,--drank my tea and ate my toast, and
                  occasionally listened to the complaint of an unfortunate Irish damsel,
                  with her customary account of 'a pain in me side an' a flutterin' about me
                  heart.' At rare intervals I ministered to some of her countrywomen in
                  their fulfilment of the great command when placed in the Garden of Eden.
                  (What a dirty place it would have been if inhabited by Irish women!)</p>

                <p>"And thus I spent nearly a year without a single call to any person of
                  character. I think I should have left in despair if it had not been for a
                  lovely creature up the street. She was the wife of a distinguished fish
                  merchant down town.</p>

                <p>"This lovely woman was Mrs. Mackerel. I will explain how it was that I
                  was summoned to her ladyship's mansion, and had the pleasure of seeing Mr.
                  Mackerel, of the firm of 'Mackerel, Haddock &amp; Dun.'</p>

                <p>"One bitter cold night in January, just as I was about to retire, a
                  furious ring at the front door made me feel particularly amiable! A
                  servant announced the sudden and alarming illness of Mrs. Mackerel, with
                  the assurance that as the family physician was out of town, Mrs. M. would
                  be obliged if I would immediately visit her. Accordingly, I soon found
                  myself in the presence of the accomplished lady, having--I confess
                  it--given my hair an extra touch as I entered the beautiful chamber.</p>

                <p>"Mrs. Mackerel was not a bad-tempered lady; she was only a beautiful
                  fool--nothing less, dear reader, or she would have never married old
                  Mackerel. Her charms would have procured her a husband of at least a
                  tolerable exterior. His physiognomy presented a remarkable resemblance to
                  his namesake. Besides, he chewed and smoked, and the combination of the
                  aroma of his favorite luxuries with the articles of his merchandise must
                  have been most uncongenial to the curve of such lips and such nostrils as
                  Mrs. Mackerel's.</p>

                <p>"I was received by Mr. Mackerel in a manner that increased observation has
                  since taught me is sufficiently indicative of the hysterical _finale_ of a
                  domestic dialogue. He was not so obtuse as to let me directly into the
                  true cause of his wife's nervous attack and his own collectedness, and yet
                  he felt it would not answer to make too light of it before me.</p>

                <p>"Mr. and Mrs. M. had just returned from a party. (The party must be the
                  'scape-goat'!) He assured me that as the lady was in the full enjoyment of
                  health previously, he felt obliged to attribute the cause of her attack
                  and speechless condition--for she spoke not one word, or gave a sign--to
                  the dancing, heated room, and the supper.</p>

                <p>"I was fully prepared to realize the powers of ice-cream, cake, oranges,
                  chicken-salad, oysters, sugar-plums, punch, and champagne, and at one
                  moment almost concluded to despatch a servant for an emetic of ipecac;
                  but--I prudently avoided it. Aside from the improbability of excess of
                  appetite through the portal of such a mouth, the lovely color of the
                  cheeks and lips utterly forbade a conclusion favorable to Mr. Mackerel's
                  solution of the cause.</p>

                <p>"I placed my finger on her delicate and jewelled wrist. All seemed calm as
                  the thought of an angel's breast!

                  <p>"I was nonplussed. 'Could any tumultuous passion ever have agitated that
                    bosom so gently swelling in repose?'</p>

                  <p>"Mackerel's curious questions touching my sagacity as to his wife's
                    condition received about as satisfactory a solution as do most questions
                    put to me on the cause and treatment of diseases; and having tolerably
                    befogged him with opinions, and lulled his suspicions to rest, by the
                    apparent innocent answers to his leading questions, he arrived at the
                    conclusion most desirable to him, viz., that I was a fool--a conviction
                    quite necessary in some nervous cases....</p>

                  <p>"So pleased was Mr. M. with the soothing influences of my brief visit that
                    he very courteously waited on me to the outside door, instead of ordering
                    a servant to show me out, and astonished me by desiring me to call on the
                    patient again in the morning.</p>

                  <p>"After my usual diversion of investigating 'a pain an' a flutterin' about
                    me heart,' and an 'O, I'm kilt intirely,' I visited Mrs. Mackerel, and had
                    the extreme pleasure of finding her quite composed, and in conversation
                    with her fashionable friend, Mrs. Tiptape. The latter was the daughter of
                    a 'retired milliner,' and had formed a desirable union with Tiptape, the
                    eminent dry goods merchant. Fortunately--for she was a woman of
                    influence--I passed the critical examination of Mrs. T. unscathed by her
                    sharp black eyes, and, as the sequel will show, was considered by her
                    'quite an agreeable person.'</p>

                  <p>"Poor Mrs. Mackerel, notwithstanding her efforts to conceal it, had
                    evidently received some cruel and stunning communication from her husband
                    on the night of my summons; her agitated circulation during the fortnight
                    of my attendance showed to my conviction some persistent and secret cause
                    for her nervousness.</p>

                  <p>"One evening she assured me that she felt she should now rapidly recover,
                    as Mr. Mackerel had concluded to take her to Saratoga. I, of course,
                    acquiesced in the decision, though my previous opinion had not been asked.
                    I took a final leave of the lovely woman, and the poor child soon departed
                    for Saratoga.</p>

                  <p>"The ensuing week there was a sheriff's sale at Mackerel's residence. The
                    day following the Mackerels' departure, Mr. Tiptape did me the honor to
                    inquire after the health of my family; and a week later, Master Tiptape
                    having fallen and bumped his dear nose on the floor, I had the felicity of
                    soothing the anguish of his mamma in her magnificent _boudoir_, and
                    holding to her lovely nose the smelling salts, and offering such
                    consolation as her trying position required!"</p>

                  <p>Thus was commenced the practice of one of the first physicians of New
                    York. The facts are avouched for. The names, of course, are manufactured,
                    to cover the occupation of the parties. The doctor still lives, in the
                    enjoyment of a lucrative and respectable practice, and the love and
                    confidence of his numerous friends and patrons.</p>

                  <p>Quite as ludicrous scenes could be revealed by most physicians, if they
                    would but take the time to think over their earlier efforts, and the
                    various circumstances which were mainly instrumental in getting them into
                    a respectable practice.</p>
